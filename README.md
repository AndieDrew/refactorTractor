## Abstract
The application is designed for meal planning, where users are presented with a host of recipe options. Users have the capability to favorite recipes and/or add them to a to-do list. Users can only add a recipe to their to-do list if they have the required ingredients, and the ingredients' amounts are subtracted from their pantry when doing so; removing a recipe from this list replaces the ingredient amounts in the user's pantry.

When opening the recipe card, a user sees what ingredients are needed for the recipe, the total cost of the recipe ingredients, and instructions to make the recipe.

A user can search for a recipes with words either found in the recipe name or within the recipe ingredients list.

## Learning Goals
Working off the codebase of an incomplete project, our primary goal was to refactor the existing code while working toward our learning goals.

Many users stories from the original spec sheet were incomplete or had broken functionality.

We were tasked with replacing local datasets to endpoints linked to an API. Additionally, we added in SASS to our stylesheets, used spy testing in our chai to make sure DOM updates were called, and added in accessibility qualities to our application.
* Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone elseâ€™s codebase
* Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and that everyone understands it
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure your app is following best practices for accessibility
* Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
* Incorporate Webpack to streamline your workflow process
* Leverage Chai Spies to verify that your DOM manipulation is happening
